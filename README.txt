# Naloxone Advocates Plymouth CIC — Static Website

This is a simple static HTML/CSS/JS site (no backend).

## Run locally
Option 1: just double-click `index.html` (works, but some browsers restrict features).
Option 2 (recommended): run a tiny local server:

Python:
- `python -m http.server 8000`
- open http://localhost:8000

## Deploy
Upload the folder to any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Vercel static, etc.).
